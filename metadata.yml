description: Minimize a biomolecule and automatically parameterize any bound small molecules.
methods: |
  This workflow requires a protein structure with a bound ligand. By default parameters are assigned
  to the protein, while GAFF2 parameters with Gasteiger partial charges are assigned to any bound
  ligands. The structure is then minimized for up to 4000 steps using first MDT's steepest descent
  module to remove clashes, then OpenMM's conjugate gradient minimizer.
